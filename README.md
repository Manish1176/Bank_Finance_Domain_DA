# 📊 Loan Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and computing key **loan-related KPIs** using Python. The analysis provides insights into **loan applications, funding amounts, repayments, borrower profiles, and risk evaluation (Good vs Bad Loans)**. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data that can help financial institutions make informed decisions.

## ✅ Business Requirements
The project is divided into two main parts:

### **BRD 1: KPI Requirements**
Key metrics to calculate:
- **Total Loan Applications** – Number of loan applications received.
- **Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications**.
- **Total Funded Amount** – Total amount disbursed as loans.
- **MTD Funded Amount**.
- **Total Amount Received** – Amount repaid by borrowers.
- **MTD Amount Received**.
- **Average Interest Rate** – Overall lending cost analysis.
- **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio** – Borrowers' financial health.

#### **Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs**
- **Good Loan Metrics:**
  - Good Loan Application Percentage
  - Good Loan Applications
  - Good Loan Funded Amount
  - Good Loan Total Received Amount

- **Bad Loan Metrics:**
  - Bad Loan Application Percentage
  - Bad Loan Applications
  - Bad Loan Funded Amount
  - Bad Loan Total Received Amount

### **BRD 2: Analysis Requirements**
The analysis includes:
1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date** – Identifying seasonal and long-term trends in lending.
2. **Regional Analysis by State** – Comparing lending activity across regions.
3. **Loan Term Distribution** – Understanding how loans are spread across different term lengths.
4. **Employment Length Analysis** – Examining how employment history impacts loans.
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown** – Analyzing common reasons for borrowing.
6. **Home Ownership Impact** – Studying the effect of home ownership on loan metrics.
